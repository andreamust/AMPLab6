# AMPLab Module 6: Symbolic Music Processing with Music21

This repository contains materials for the sixth module of the [AMPLab course](https://www.upf.edu/web/smc), part of the Master's in Sound and Music Computing at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

## Overview

This module focuses on symbolic music processing using the Music21 Python library. Music21 is a toolkit for computer-aided musicology that allows for the analysis, manipulation, and creation of musical scores.

## Contents

- Jupyter notebooks with demonstrations
- Practical exercises and solutions
- Additional resources


## Requirements

### Software

1. **Python 3.8+** and **Jupyter Notebook**

2. **Required Libraries**
   - Will be installed via the requirements.txt file

3. **Score Visualization Software**
   - If you don't have music notation software already installed, we strongly recommend the open source program [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/).
   - If you already have a preferred music notation software, you can configure music21 to use it by following the instructions [here](https://music21.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/index.html).
